    "# Model of Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is of our interest to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms, we need a way to compare the time they might need to execute in a way that is independent of hardware. But a machine-independent approach requires some assumptions, as different architecutres may support some operations faster than others. Thus, to be as precise as possible, throughout this notebook we are going to consider a Random Access Machine Model which we will develop so that it is as specific as possible on the number of steps done by a processor. Moreover, the usual abstraction behind libraries allows us to consider a general time complexity for the functions and objects it supports but it is rather difficult to determine a specific complexity, thus for objects like unordered_sets we will just consider single operation insertions.\n",

    "## The Random Access Machine\n",

    "\n",

    "    * `for` loops require an initialization instruction (usually a value is assigned to a variable).\n",

    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously such an abstraction does not match any real machine, we can start by noticing that most computers add faster than they divide, the increment operation could easily make the addition and then assign the value (2 instructions in the model) but it is considered a single step instruction (due to its constant general complexity), calling functions requires cloning variables and adding the function to the call stack (that cannot possibly be done without any instruction). However, with this model we are trying to establish a convention that can map somewhat directly to our experience using computers, arithmetic is fast, printing relatively small texts in a terminal environment or in a file is super fast as well, to name a few of our considerations."

    "It is obvious that for this problem 2 queens cannot be placed in the same row or column, thus a simple divide and conquer approach could be to place queens on each column and memoize the row, so that we reduce the possibilities dramatically: \n",
    "\n",
    "* First we can put a queen on any of the 8 rows of the first column \n",
    "\n",
    "* Then we only have 7 valid rows for the second column\n",
    "\n",
    "* Afterwards there are 6 rows for the third... \n",
    "\n",
    "* In general, for the $i$th column there are $8 - i$ possible positions to choose\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using the multiplication principle, this means the dynamic programming approach described has as little as $8!\\approx 40 000$ possibilities to check. We can even save some time by checking if any piece is threatened through the diagonals, given the fact that this can be computed in constant time and we could use recursion to backtrack. This is nothing for today's computing power and if you had the patience to wait for a solution with the Brute Force approach, this solution might astonish you (or it might not surprise you since the order of magnitude on the possibilites decreases at least by 5 orders of magnitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this approach and the reason it may be considered a Dynamic Programming solution is that it solves a simpler subproblem: placing $i$ queens on an $8 \\times i$ board; which is then used to try and solve the next subproblem: placing $i+1$ queens on an  $8 \\times \\left(i + 1\\right)$ board. Since not all solutions to an $8 \\times i$ allow for valid solutions of the next subproblem we include the backtracking, while memoizing the valid rows and diagonals in sets to avoid doing unecessary computations: once a queen threatens a row or diagonal, no other queen can be placed on that row and diagonal. Since we are placing a queen per column we are not concerned by storing the valid columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To show the results it is way more efficient to store them in a file (`solutions.txt.`) than printing them, since we can avoid doing the work again and check them without executing the program. Now, to avoid the program from writing the file again we can just check if the list of solutions in the file is complete, this could be done traversing the file but that operation is relatively expensive as it grows with the size of the file; a much more efficient approach (in terms of time complexity) is to sacrifice some disk space and a constant number of steps writing to another file (`count.txt`) which will hold the number of solutions found; given the fact that there are only 92 solutions to the 8 Queens Problem we just need to check if that is the value stored in the file, otherwise we make the computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement we won't delve into is using multiple threads to obtain results faster with concurrency. The reason we did not take this approach is the fact that there is a critical region: all threads want to append their solutions to the same file. We could avoid this problem creating a temporal file per thread and after the main execution call the `cat` command to merge the results, then `rm` the temporal files, however a Windows system will break if we try to execute bash commands. Another improvement may be to consider a way to resume the execution given we store the number of solutions found and we can start at that solution, however making an association between natural numbers and the configuration of the queens is not that straight forward; even though one could read the file and determine the last configuration found, finding a way to resume the execution is not that straight forward as a stack of configurations is stored due to the recursion in the execution, furthermore the program might have halted previously while writing the solution to the file and thus it may be incomplete in the text file."

Then with that information, we can create a function that mimics the behaviour of this one, but that recieves an additional integer by reference that serves as an instruction counter. This method is valid, since the size of the board and the number of queens to place is fixed at 8, thus even if we check a lot of possible configurations the execution of the program will always be the same. Even though the size of the queens set and of the valid rows and diagonals varies with each call to the function, the queens array starts at a value of 1 the first time we call the function in main and it increases up to a maximum of 8, for the rows and diagonals, these start with a size of 7 and 14 respectively but they only decrease.

Since the number of queens and the chess board is not able to change in this implementation, the second solution will always execute the same amount of steps and is therefore a constant time algorithm.\n",
