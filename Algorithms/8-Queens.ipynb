    "# The 8 Queens Problem\n",

    "Given an $8 \\times 8$ chess board, we want to find all the possible ways to fit 8 queens in it without them threatening each other (see the valid solution below). To solve this problem we are required to use 2 distinct algorithm design techniques: *Brute Force* and either *Divide & Conquer* or *Dynamic Programming*.\n",

    "## Brute Force\n",
    "For the Brute Force solution we only need to find one valid configuration of the queens, thus we can use a randomized algorithm that places queens arbitrarly on the board (while avoiding it from placing queens on the same spot, something easy to implement with a hash set) until it finds a valid solution. ince we know the 8 queens problem has at least a valid solution, this algorithm should eventually converge to one of them (there are 92 possible solutions)."

    "## Dynamic Programming\n",
    "It is obvious that for this problem 2 queens cannot be placed in the same row or column, thus a simple divide and conquer approach could be to place queens on each column and memoize the row, so that we reduce the possibilities dramatically: \n",
    "    First we can put a queen on any of the 8 rows of the first column, then we only have 7 valid rows for the second column, 6 rows for the third, ... In general, we have $8 - i$ possibilities for column $i$. Using the multiplication principle, this means a dynamic programming approach has as little as $8!$ possibilities, which is a little bit more than 40,000 scenarios to check (a computer can check this really fast). To speed it up we could even use 8 threads so that each one uses a different initial row and append the results to a file so that we don't have to look for the solutions again."
